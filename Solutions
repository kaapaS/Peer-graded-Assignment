Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:

1. Python
2. R
3. SQL
4. Julia
5. Scala
6. C/C++
7. JavaScript
8. Java

1. TensorFlow.
2. NumPy.
3. SciPy.
4. Pandas.
5. Matplotlib.
6. Keras.
7. PyTorch.

Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools. (3 pts)

Data Science Tools:

                            * Data Science Tools		
* SAS. It is one of those data science tools which are specifically designed for statistical operation
* Apache Spark
* BigML


Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples. (1 pt)

#
#Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("9+8", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)
17
Volume of a sphere
import math
code2 = compile("4 / 3 * math.pi * math.pow(64, 3)", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code2)
1098066.2194435236


Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.(2 pts)

This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply, subtract then add integers

 + 80
(3*8-5) + 80
99

Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours. (2 pts)

This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

days = 0
hours = 0
mins = 0
​
time = 3600
#days = time / 1440
leftover_minutes = time % 1440
hours = leftover_minutes / 60
#mins = time - (days*1440) - (hours*60)
print(str(days) + " days, " + str(hours) + " hours, " + str(mins) +  " mins. ")
​
0 days, 12.0 hours, 0 mins. 


Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives.

Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). 
In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.

Exercise 11 - Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author’s name
